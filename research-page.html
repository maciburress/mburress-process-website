						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p class="info">Before creating the website, I dove into deep primary and secondary researches as well as interviewing members of the organization to get a better understanding of what their goals and purposes are.</p>

					<p2>Beginning the primary research, visiting the client's website is step one in finding key insights of the organization. The website provides a lot of useful information on what they do and how one can become a member.</p2><br>
				</br>
			  	<p2><b>General Information: </b>
					<p2>The daily activity at a Clubhouse is similar to any work place, consisting of 8-hour days, Monday through Friday. Members work at the clubhouse developing skills both mentally and professionally that they can use for future living.</p2><br>
				</br>
					<p2><b>New Day Services: </b>
					<p2>Employees provide members with social and vocational skills, administrative services, such as word processing, data entry, billing, and other responsibilites, such as lawn care, cleaning, snack bar operations, and food services. These responsibilites provide members with a variety of work experiences for future jobs.</p2><br>
				</br>

          <header>
					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
				</header>
					<p2> Clubhouses are used specifically for mental illness individuals who want and seek help. Individuals who join clubhouses are referred to as “members.”</p2>
            <p2>  1. The Clubhouse model has been proved to be an effective way to help mentally ill people to transition into everyday life.</p2><br>

			  	</br><p2>  2. Because of the popularity of social media, New Day Clubhouse should become more accessible on multiple online platforms. They currently are only on facebook. Becoming more accessible on facebook, instagram, twitter, and snapchat would help the clubhouse be more prevalent online, gaining more clients, support, and donations. </p2><br>

				</br><p2>  3. Similar non-profit organizations / competitors:<br>
				</br><p2> These are non-profit organization located in local or neighboring areas to New Day Clubhouse. They provide support to people with disabilities and special needs. Their website has a more professional look as well as a more effective color scheme. They have the same mission to providing aid to those who are mentally ill in hopes of them becoming self-sufficient individuals. They all have a better or more effective website and a larger marketing platform.<p2>
