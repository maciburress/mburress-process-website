						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p class="info">Before creating the website, I dove into deep primary and secondary researches as well as interviewing members of the organization to get a better understanding of what their goals and purposes are.</p>

					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
					<div class="M2-P1-P2a/new-day-clubhouse-website.png">

					<p> New Day provides members with social and vocational skills to successfully adjust to community life. Members volunteer in one of three different areas at the center: administrative services, such as word processing, data entry and billing; membership services, such as lawn care, cleaning and snack bar operations; and food services, such as meal planning and preparation and shopping for groceries.
              The center also helps members with transitional employment at local businesses.
              The kitchen allows members to prepare healthier meals from scratch without having to use prepackaged and processed items
              A need base programs
              Music, art, games, activities

              The daily activity at a Clubhouse is similar to any work place, consisting of 8-hour days Monday through Friday. Members and staff work side-by-side, performing work for the Clubhouse. Members are encouraged to participate as they are ready and quickly become relied upon. Typical daily work includes:
              planning and preparing lunch for Clubhouse colleagues.
              maintaining attendance and accounting records for billing purposes.
              communications about Clubhouse events, employment celebrations, and membership tours.
              Long term goal is for members to live independently in the community by becoming self-sufficient individuals.</p>

					<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
					<p> Clubhouses are used specifically for mental illness individuals who want and seek help. Individuals who join clubhouses are referred to as “members.”</p>
            <p>  1. The Clubhouse model has been proved to be an effective way to help mentally ill people to transition into everyday life. (https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170510/NEWS/170519994/not-for-profit-s-clubhouse-model-effectively-treats-mental-illness-study-says)

                 Reviews on the “clubhouse models”

            <p>  2. Because of the popularity of social media, New Day Clubhouse could become more accessible on multiple online platforms. (They currently are only on facebook) Facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, etc. Being consistent with posts is also key.</p>

            <p>  3. Similar non-profit organization competitors:
                 These are non-profit organization located in local or neighboring areas to New Day Clubhouse. They provide support to people with disabilities and special needs. Their website has a more professional look as well as a more effective color scheme. They have the same mission to providing aid to those who are mentally ill in hopes of them becoming self-sufficient individuals. They all have a better or more effective website and a larger marketing platform.
