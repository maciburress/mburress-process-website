					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
				</header>
					<p> Clubhouses are used specifically for mental illness individuals who want and seek help. Individuals who join clubhouses are referred to as “members.”</p>
            <p>  1. The Clubhouse model has been proved to be an effective way to help mentally ill people to transition into everyday life. (https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170510/NEWS/170519994/not-for-profit-s-clubhouse-model-effectively-treats-mental-illness-study-says)

                 Reviews on the “clubhouse models”

            <p>  2. Because of the popularity of social media, New Day Clubhouse could become more accessible on multiple online platforms. (They currently are only on facebook) Facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, etc. Being consistent with posts is also key.</p>

            <p>  3. Similar non-profit organization competitors:
                 These are non-profit organization located in local or neighboring areas to New Day Clubhouse. They provide support to people with disabilities and special needs. Their website has a more professional look as well as a more effective color scheme. They have the same mission to providing aid to those who are mentally ill in hopes of them becoming self-sufficient individuals. They all have a better or more effective website and a larger marketing platform.
