									<h2>Interviews</h2>
									<p> The overall problem with the current New Day Clubhouse website is that it is disorganized and doesn’t have the right “feel.” Since the organization’s purpose is aiding mentally ill people in becoming functioning members of society, the website should reflect that. In order to do this, a different color scheme, consisting of calming, peaceful colors, would help convey that. A more organized and concise layout will also contribute to a better user experience and provide a pleasant aesthetic.</p>
