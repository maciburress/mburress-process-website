									<h4>Interviews</h4>
									<p>After interviewing several different potential audience members, I used their input for my final solution.</p>
									<p2>The executive director of New Day Clubhouse, Jane Clemmer, felt that their website lacked information and needed more imagery and organization. William Worley, a former member of New Day Clubhouse, liked the website and thought it was overall effective but perhaps a different color scheme would be helpful. Although Jane Clemmer and William Worley gave helpful insights, their responses may be skewed because of their involvement with the organizations so I thought it was important to interview other people who might consider using the website, such as my former roommates mom, and my sister. Becuase they both suffer from anxiety, and or other mental disorders, I felt their insights about how the website makes them feel would help determine what the website should display.
