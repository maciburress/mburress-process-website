					<p>1. Problem to Solve
                To assist the mentally ill so that they may become individual, functioning members of society</p>
          <p>2. Design Question
                How does the New Day Clubhouse website offer services that promote help for mentally ill citizens?</p>
          <p>3. Ultimate Impact
                To provide recovery services, support, and donations to help mentally ill persons to live a normal life.</p>
          <p>4. Possible Solutions
                Website: information hierarchy, layout organization, color scheme, images, and usability will all contribute to the appeal of the audience and promote interest from the public.</p>
          <p>5. Context and Constraints
                One location, reaching only the spartanburg area / small organization / only on one form of social media platform (Facebook)</p>
          <p>6. Design Question Tweak
                How can I provide a more user friendly, dynamic website that will both reach the mentally ill persons and the general public so that mentally ill individuals can receive the recovery services they need or want and the general public will provide donations or volunteer support?</p>

					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
					<p> New Day provides members with social and vocational skills to successfully adjust to community life. Members volunteer in one of three different areas at the center: administrative services, such as word processing, data entry and billing; membership services, such as lawn care, cleaning and snack bar operations; and food services, such as meal planning and preparation and shopping for groceries.
              The center also helps members with transitional employment at local businesses.
              The kitchen allows members to prepare healthier meals from scratch without having to use prepackaged and processed items
              A need base programs
              Music, art, games, activities

              The daily activity at a Clubhouse is similar to any work place, consisting of 8-hour days Monday through Friday. Members and staff work side-by-side, performing work for the Clubhouse. Members are encouraged to participate as they are ready and quickly become relied upon. Typical daily work includes:
              planning and preparing lunch for Clubhouse colleagues.
              maintaining attendance and accounting records for billing purposes.
              communications about Clubhouse events, employment celebrations, and membership tours.
              Long term goal is for members to live independently in the community by becoming self-sufficient individuals.
