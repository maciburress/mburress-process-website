						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">First, we had to answer a series of questions that comes from the Human Centered Design toolkit, which allowed me to get more specific about the problem I am trying to solve.</p>
					</header>
					<p>1. First, what is the problem you are trying to solve?</p>
                <p>To assist the mentally ill so that they may become individual, functioning members of society</p>
          <p>2. What is your design question?</p>
                <p>How does the New Day Clubhouse website offer services that promote help for mentally ill citizens?</p>
          <p>3. Next, what is the ultimate impact you wish to have?</p>
                <p>To provide recovery services, support, and donations to help mentally ill persons to live a normal life.</p>
          <p>4. What are some possible solutions?</p>
                <p>Website: information hierarchy, layout organization, color scheme, images, and usability will all contribute to the appeal of the audience and promote interest from the public.</p>
          <p>5. Are there any contexts and contraints?</p>
                <p>One location, reaching only the spartanburg area / small organization / only on one form of social media platform (Facebook)</p>
          <p>6. Finally, does your design question need a tweak?</p>
                <p>How can I provide a more user friendly, dynamic website that will both reach the mentally ill persons and the general public so that mentally ill individuals can receive the recovery services they need or want and the general public will provide donations or volunteer support?</p>
