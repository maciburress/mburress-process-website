						<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
						<p class="info">First, we had to answer a series of questions that comes from the Human Centered Design toolkit, that allowed me to get more specific about the problem I am trying to solve.</p>
					</header>
					<p2><b>1. First, what is the problem you are trying to solve?</b></p2>
                <p2>To assist the mentally ill so that they may become individual, functioning members of society.<br>
							  <br>
          <p2><b>2. What is your design question?</b></p2>
                <p2>How does the New Day Clubhouse website offer services that provide assitance for mentally ill citizens?<br>
								<br>
          <p2><b>3. Next, what is the ultimate impact you wish to have?</b></p2>
                <p2>Provide recovery services, support, and donations to help mentally ill persons become able to function in society through gaining the ability to take care of themselves.<br>
								<br>
          <p2><b>4. What are some possible solutions?</b></p2>
                <p2>For the website, information hierarchy, layout organization, color scheme, images, and usability will all contribute to the appeal of the audience and promote interest from the public.<br>
								<br>
          <p2><b>5. Are there any contexts and contraints?</b></p2>
                <p2>New Day Clubhouse only has one location in the Spartanburg SC area. They are a relatively small organization with only on one form of social media platform, that being Facebook. Their services are not as well known as other mental health organizations.<br>
								<br>
          <p2><b>6. Finally, does your design question need a tweak?</b></p2>
                <p2>How can I provide a more user friendly, informative, and engaging website that will both reach the mentally ill persons and the general public so that mentally ill individuals can receive the recovery services they need, while the general public can provide donations or volunteer support?<br>
